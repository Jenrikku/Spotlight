# Spotlight - Super Mario 3D World Editor

Spotlight is the latest (and best) Editor for Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Wii U.<br/>
It has a boatload of features allowing you to make your very own levels, toad houses, mystery boxes, and more!

## System Requirements

- OpenGL 3.0+
- Windows 8+
- .NET 7.0+ Desktop Runtime ([download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0))

## Assistance and How to Use

A full guide to Spotlight can be found on the [Spotlight Wiki](https://github.com/jupahe64/Spotlight/wiki).

## Compiling from Source

On the original version of Spotlight, you needed to download GL_EditorFramework's source separately in order to compile it.<br/>

**This is not the case anymore** - All you need to do is clone the repository* and you are good to go!<br/>
You may want to use dotnet build or your IDE of preference.

\* Make sure you use ` git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Jenrikku/Spotlight-NET.git` in order to clone dependencies (submodules) as well.
